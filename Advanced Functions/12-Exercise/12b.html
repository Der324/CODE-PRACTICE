    //Creating a Function and storing it in a Variable

    //store that function in a variable named add.

      console.log(2 + 3);

    // create a function named runTwice that accepts a function as an argument (named fun)
    //runs that faction two times.
    //In JavaScript, functions can be passed around like variables 
    // which is a core concept called HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS.
